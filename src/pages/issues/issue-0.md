# Issue 0: The Architects

Welcome to the beginning. This is not a manifesto — it’s a scaffold.

**Architects of Meaning (AxM)** is a curatorial experiment, designed to elevate and interlink the builders of tomorrow’s symbolic systems. We publish thinkers, builders, and boundary-crossers exploring new ways to construct meaning in a world shifting from centralized institutions to recursive agents and verifiable trust.

### This issue includes:

- A conversation with the creator of Skyla, a symbolic AI agent verified by recursive zero-knowledge proofs.
- A breakdown of the “Ritual Stack” — the latent symbolic scaffolding behind DAOs, festivals, and social interfaces.
- Essays on federated interpretation, post-linear narratives, and zk-attested memory.

You won’t find clickbait or consensus here. Just the ongoing process of pattern recognition — and pattern construction.

Welcome to Issue 0.
